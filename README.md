Lunar landings by renowned space stations across the world have yielded an abundance of new scientific data on the Moon. The various experiments placed on the surface provided information on seismic, gravitational, and other lunar characteristics. The purpose of this was to make a Machine Learning model which classifies the different rocks present on the moon's surface.
